Hello! I’m **Valentine Indieka**, a Computer Science graduate who loves turning ideas into digital solutions.

My journey into technology started long before I ever wrote my first line of code — I’ve always enjoyed mending things, especially software, and figuring out how they work under the hood. That curiosity has grown into a passion for building systems that simplify how people work and interact with technology.  

I’ve developed web applications using **PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and MySQL**, and I’m always exploring new tools and frameworks.

I’m especially interested in **cybersecurity** and navigating my path in the field. Check out my **Posts** section for more insights into my projects and learning journey.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me spending time with family and friends, travelling, or playing netball.
