Hello! I’m Valentine Indieka, a Computer Science graduate who loves turning ideas into digital solutions.

My journey into technology started long before I ever wrote my first line of code — I’ve always enjoyed mending things, especially software, and figuring out how they work under the hood. That curiosity has grown into a passion for building systems that simplify how people work and interact with technology. I’ve developed web applications using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and MySQL, and I’m always exploring new tools and frameworks.

I’m especially interested in cybersecurity and navigating my path in the field. Look at the posts section for more details

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me spending time with family and friends, travelling or playing netball
